  "About": {
    "paragraph": "It all began with an entrepreneurship course, where our group of eight brainstormed business ideas. Among various suggestions, one member proposed Japanese cream puffs, which we eagerly pursued. The idea gained praise, and our lecturer encouraged us to take it further.Eventually, only two of us committed to continuing, later inviting a friend from accounting to join the team. We won several competitions and national awards. During the pandemic, we adapted by shifting to online sales.After two years, we opened a physical shop at Kuching and expanded our market by participating in events across Kuching-Samarahan. With our sights set high, we aim to take the business to the next level.",
